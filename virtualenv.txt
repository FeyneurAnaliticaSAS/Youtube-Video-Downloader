How to create an virtual environment in Python? 
 
 --> This is optional, but its a great idea when you start a new project, also its easy. 

* What is a virtual environment? 
    First you need to understand what is a library or package. For each project you will need 
    differents libraries, for example: If you want to perform math calculation you should import
    the "math" library.  
    Its not a good idea to install all the libreries in the same "space", if you have a project 
    related with Data Science for sure you will need "Pandas" and if at the same time you are working
    on a project that need to perform geospacial graphics you will need "Geopandas". 
    The best thing to do its to create dos little spaces on your PC, one that have Pandas and the other one
    that have Geopandas. 

* How we do that? 
1.- Install globally virtualenv with "pip install virtualenv" 
2.- Navigate to the directory where you have the project. 
3.- execute --> virtualenv [name_of_the_enviroment] on terminal. 
        We usually named our environment "env" 
4.- execute --> source env/bin/activate.  

Now when we install a library that library only will work on the environment..
